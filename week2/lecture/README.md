# WebDev 1 - by Yee Yang
The starting place for my WebDev1 Students

For my WebDev1 students, if you are reading this for the very first time -- you're in the right place.

After you've created a GitHub account, you'll want to fork this repository by using the `Fork` button in the upper righthand corner of this *page*. What this will do is create a 'copy' of my codebase to your GitHub account. That copy will then be yours to do as you please.

When and if you want to make edits to these files, from **your** copy of the repository, you may download a `ZIP` file or choose to use the [GitHub desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/) from the upper righthand corner of this *section*. For ease of reference, I would recommend you use the `ZIP` file option *for now*. You'll find these buttons on the same row as the Green `New pull request` button but to the far right.

When you're done editing your files, you can hit `Upload Files` from this screen and 'drag and drop' your weeks' folder into this area. Enter a title and a message for your commit.

# Homework
All homework is due on or before Monday @ 02:00 AM EST. For each day that the assignment is late will be a letter grade off.

## Turning in your homework
You will submit a **Pull Request** to my version of the repository from your version of your repository. To do so (in the main `/webdev1` directory):
+ Click on the Green `New pull request` button
+ Note, you'll see a bar that begins with `base fork:` (my version) and another `head fork:` (your version)
+ You'll also be able to see all the lines of code you've changed along with any images you may have added
+ If you see a Green `checkmark` with a message of 'Able to merge' -- then all is well and click on the `Create pull request` button; otherwise, we've run into problems and you should contact me right away.
+ Clicking on the `Create pull request` button will send me a notification that you've submitted code to me.
+ DON'T FORGET TO UPLOAD IT TO THE FTP SERVER
